# Sarcasm-and-Toxicity-detection-in-Reddit-Comments-Using-GloVe
The project aimed at predicting  sarcasm and  toxicity based on Kaggle Sarcasm Headlines dataset using GloVe embeddings, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.
# Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:
##### To preprocess and vectorize text data using pre-trained GloVe embeddings.
##### To train and evaluate Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers for sarcasm detection.
##### To compare performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
##### To implement an interactive prediction tool that allows users to analyze new input.
##### To provide a simple toxicity heuristic by scanning input text against a curated toxic word lexicon.
